// Question: Demonstrate the use of assignment operators by incrementing, decrementing, and manipulating a variable with different arithmetic operations.

let a= 10,b =20,c=30,d=40,e=50,f=60;
a += 10;
b -= 5;
c *= 1000;
d **= 4;
e /= 2;
f %= 7;

console.log(`a : ${a}, b : ${b}, c : ${c}, d : ${d}, e : ${e}, f : ${f}`);
