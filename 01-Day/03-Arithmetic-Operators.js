// Question: Given two numbers, calculate and log their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

let a= 10, b=100;

console.log(`sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a+b}`);
console.log(`difference of ${a} and ${b} is ${a-b}`);
console.log(`product of ${a} and ${b} is ${a*b}`);
console.log(`quotient of ${a} and ${b} is ${b/a}`);
console.log(`remainder of ${a} and ${b} is ${b-(a*(b/a))}`);
